<p>Tracker Poker is a way to automate the planning poker 
meeting on an Agile project using a mobile phone. 
This can be used for distributed teams or even being in the same room.</p>

<p>The best way Iâ€™ve found for agile teams to estimate is by playing planning poker (Grenning 2002). 
  Planning poker combines expert opinion, analogy, and disaggregation into an enjoyable approach to 
  estimating that results in quick but reliable estimates.</p>
